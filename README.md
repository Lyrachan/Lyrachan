👋 Hi, I’m Jorge Lira, from Santiago, Chile. (You can call me Lyra if you wish).

I’m interested in learning everything that can be used to solve tasks and problems. ✨
I'm a nurse (RN), and also a developer in development (pun intended) ☝🤓

I'm a web developer and Data Analyst. I'm constantly learning new technologies to solve problems.

Technologies:
- Ruby on Rails
- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- JQuery
- R for Data Analysis and Data Visualization

Currently learning:
- Javascript Full-Stack
- React
- C
- Java


Here's my current web Portfolio (made with RoR): https://portfolio-rails-2.onrender.com/

I’m looking to collaborate on everything that fits my current capacities, and beyond :D

Lately I've been working as a freelance maintenance developer for some websites. Also, you can take a look to the pages in my repositories to make an idea about what i've learned during my first bootcamp. I can learn everything is there to learn, so I adapt myself to any job needed.
You can contact me via email: jorge.liram9@gmail.com
