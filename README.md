👋 Hi, I’m Jorge Lira, from Santiago, Chile. (You can call me Lyra if you wish).

I’m interested in learning everything that can be used to solve tasks and problems. ✨
I'm a nurse (RN), and also a developer in development (pun intended) ☝🤓

I'm a web developer. Right now i'm taking a Data Analysis course at Google

Technologies:
- Ruby on Rails
- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- JQuery

Currently learning:
- React
- Data Analysis

Here's my current web Portfolio (made with RoR): https://portfolio-rails-2.onrender.com/

I’m looking to collaborate on everything that fits my current capacities, and beyond :D

I don't have "real" experience (only coding for a bootcamp), but you can take a look to the pages in my repositories to make an idea about what i've learned. I can learn everything is there to learn, so I adapt myself to any job needed.
You can contact me via email: jorge.liram9@gmail.com
