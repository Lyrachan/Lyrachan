ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lyra, from Santiago, Chile.
Iâ€™m interested in learning everything that can be used to solve tasks and problems.
I'm a nurse (RN), and also a developer in development (pun intended)
Currently learning Ruby on Rails and Data Analysis.

Here's my current web Portfolio (made with RoR): https://portfolio-rails-2.onrender.com/

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on everything that fits my current capacities, and beyond.

I don't have "real" experience (only coding for a bootcamp), but you can take a look to the pages in my repositories to make an idea about what i've learned. I can learn everything is there to learn, so I adapt myself to any job needed.
You can contact me via email: jorge_liram@gmail.com
